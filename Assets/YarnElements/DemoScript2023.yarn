Hey I am Officer Watson, my dear friend Doctor Johnson was stabbed last night on his way home.  #line:NPCCube1_line1

Have you heard about the recent murder in this area? #line:0b5bf33 

-> Yes, I know who the murderer is. #line:01a5d6a
    Nice try, pal. You need to talk to the suspects first before making wild accusations. Get some evidence, then come back. #line:051404c 
    -> Sorry for wasting your time. #line:04d192e 
        No worries. #line:0b0d401 
    -> No, I actully found some evidence that can put the killer behind bars. #line:0b0933d 
        Show me what you found friend. #line:0bc31a1 
        <<if $foundevidence is true and $murderadmitted is true>>
        -> I found the weapon used to kill Doctor Johnson and Craig Cole admitted to the murder.  #line:062f7d7 
            Oh yeah with this we can put Craig Cole behind bars for a long time and the city is safe from a dangerous person like him.  #line:0c3e435 
        <<endif>>  
        <<if $murderadmitted is true and $foundevidence is false>>
        -> The killer admitted to having a personal vandeta with Doctor Johnson and killing him. His name is Craig Cole #line:01b2266 
            That is not enough to convince the jury, find some physical evidence. #line:058893e 
        <<endif>>
        <<if $foundevidence is true and $murderadmitted is false>>
        -> I found the weapon used to kill Doctor Johnson. #line:0619590 
            whose was it though? did you get the person to admit they commited the murder #line:0e1ac07 
        <<endif>> 
-> I am the killer. #line:08022d4 
        You think this is a joke? Claiming false allegations is a serious crime. I should arrest you right now.This is not a laughing matter. Be serious or stay out of trouble. #line:00b4cf7 
-> No, I don't know anything about it. #line:0211862 
    Alright, keep your eyes open. If you see anything suspicious, report it. We need all the help we can get. #line:0f4d080
